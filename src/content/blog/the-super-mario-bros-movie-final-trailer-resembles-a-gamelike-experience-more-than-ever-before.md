The Super Mario Bros Movie final trailer resembles a gamelike experience more than ever before
---

There was a time when movies based on video games tried to distance themselves from their source material. "This ain't no game" bragged the poster for the Super Mario Bros live-action film. however, times have changed.

The final trailer for The Super Mario Bros Movie by Illumination leans hard into its origins. "This is absolutely a game," it says. And it's not hard to see why. The trailer features scenes that look like they were lifted straight from popular Mario games.

One scene in the trailer looks like it's straight out of New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, while another one looks just like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. You can see the attention to detail, and how the makers wanted to make sure that the movie was true to its roots.

The trailer definitely gives off a game-like experience, more so than ever before. The audience can see Mario and Luigi on their adventures through different parts of the Mushroom Kingdom, with its bright colors, incredible characters, and a soundtrack that will take you through all the emotions of the game.

If you were hoping to hear more of Chris Pratt's Mario voice in the trailer, unfortunately, you won't get that. But we do see glimpses of other beloved characters such as Toad, Bowser, and even Donkey Kong. The trailer gives a feel of how the movie will dive into the entire Mario universe and bring it to life.

It's safe to say that fans are eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, which is set to hit theaters on December 21, 2021. With the final trailer embracing the game-like experience that fans know and love, we can't help but wonder what other surprises the movie will have in store for us. Fingers crossed, it does justice to the iconic Super Mario universe.
