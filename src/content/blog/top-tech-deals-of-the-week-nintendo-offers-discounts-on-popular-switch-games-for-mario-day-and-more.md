For the past few years, Nintendo has celebrated March 10 as "Mario Day" - a celebration of the company's beloved hero plumber, kart racer, and lead mascot, Mar10 (Mario, you see!). This is mostly just a clever marketing campaign, but for those looking to pad their Switch libraries, Nintendo is using the event to discount some popular titles.

From March 10 to 16, players can grab a range of Switch games at a discounted price, including some of Mario's biggest hits. Super Mario Maker 2 is 33% off, bringing it down to $39.99. New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe gets a 25% discount - down to $44.99 - and Mario Tennis Aces falls to $41.99, a 30% savings. 

But it's not just Mario games that are on offer. Other popular titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Splatoon 2 also get discounts. Right now, Breath of the Wild is 30% off, dropping to $41.99, while Splatoon 2 enjoys a 33% discount, now just $39.99.

And it's not just games that are benefiting from Nintendo's deals. Those looking to expand their Switch storage can grab a 128GB SanDisk microSD card for just $22.99, a 47% discount.

Of course, what makes this sale extra appealing is that it comes at a time when many people are stuck inside and looking for ways to stay entertained. With many of these games involving multiplayer options, they offer a way for people to connect and stay social even while staying home.

It's worth noting that some of these games are digital-only, so be sure to have enough storage on your Switch if you plan on buying them. And this sale is only available in the US, so players elsewhere will have to wait for their own respective sales.

All in all, this sale offers some great options for anyone looking to expand their Switch library or pick up a few popular titles. Just be sure to act fast, as the deals will only be around for a limited time.
